% Final Description:
%The randomness and pseudorandomness are important security property of output of a random number generator as well a cryptographic function. To some extent, these characteristics can be measured and tested by randomness statistical batteries like STS NIST or DIEHARDER. The thesis is aimed at development of a tool that would provide means for fast, simple and consistent testing of randomness of arbitrary data using multiple statistical batteries.

%The thesis will provide an introduction to statistical randomness testing and interpretation of results obtained from a given test and battery. The toolkit for easy remote execution of statistical tests on a dedicated server will be developed with the following functionality:

% - Easy submission of data for testing, both locally (filesystem) and remotely (web interface)
% - At least three different statistical batteries will be incorporated via unified interface
% - Unified presentation of test results of executed batteries
%The tool will be utilized in subsequent experiments aimed to compare classical batteries with EACirc framework and also evaluate test behavior of DIEHARDER on large amount of truly random data.

\chapter{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Randomness, why should we test it (defects, low entropy, etc...)
\item Statistical testing of randomness
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Overview of statistical batteries}
\begin{itemize}
\item Terminology related to batteries - battery, test, variant of a test, subtest, statistics, p-values
\item nist sts, dieharder, testu01
\item Each battery: overview, tests, tests into (subtests, default parameters, variants in default run), known defectes
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Randomness Testing Toolkit}
\begin{itemize}
\item Motivation - unified interface to batteries, ease of use, unified result format/representation
\item Local execution of RTT - battery and toolkit configuration, installation, brief implementation and interface overview - more thorough in documentation and comments
\item Local result format - either database or file output storage
\item Remote execution of RTT - toolkit deployed on server infrastructure, system overview (database, frontend, backend(s), storage), accessible through ssh on limited system or via web interface (django), results in database
\item Remote results of RTT - email notification, webpage layout
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Interpretation of results of RTT}
\begin{itemize}
\item Grouping subtests together - eliminating intertest bias
\item How grouping works - theory, Sidak correction, partial p-value, fail/pass of a test
\end{itemize}
 
\chapter{Analysis of outputs of cryptographic functions, comparison with EACirc}
\begin{itemize}
\item How the data were tested
\item List functions
\item List interesting (differing) results - Dieharder, NIST STS, TestU01, EACirc, polynomials(???)
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Analysis of DIEHARDER results on quantum random data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Statistical intro, uniformity, first vs. second level p-value, etc...
\item Two experiments - continuous p-values, blocks of 2nd level
\item Results - non-uniform, where it will begin to show on 2nd level results
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed user-friendly tool for easy analysis of arbitrary binary data - Randomness Testing Toolkit
\item Interpretation of results
\item Comparison of batteries with EACirc, polynomials
\item Defects in Dieharder, their relevance, etc...
\item Future work, same analysis on TestU01, dependence between tests(?), continuous development of RTT, call for flawless statistical battery ( :) )
\end{itemize}
